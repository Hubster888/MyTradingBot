# MyTradingBot
Thisrepository contains my code for a trading bot that trades on a demo account using the Oanda API.
To create this I followed a book but it was very outdated so most of the code is my own. 
The only trading stratedgy implemented is that the bot listens for tweets that provide buy and sell signals then executes them on a demo account.+
